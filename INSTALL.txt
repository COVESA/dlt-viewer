DLT Viewer - Installation
=========================
Alexander Wenzel <Alexander.AW.Wenzel@bmw.de>

Instructions for installing DLT Viewer (GUI)
--------------------------------------------

* Install Qt5 SDK including Qt Creator and MinGW (or MSVC 2013 for 32bit and 64bit Windows builds)
* Tested with QT 5.5.1, QT 5.5.0
* Open project BuildDltViewer.pro in Qt Creator.
* Ensure that build options point to correct QT and MinGW / MSVC.
* Build Release in Qt Creator or via CMake (see last).
* Optional Linux: set the library path in Qt Creator: Add variable to Projects/Build Settings/Build Environment: LD_LIBRARY_PATH = .

Instructions for installing DLT Viewer (Linux commandline)
----------------------------------------------------------

* mkdir build
* cd build
* qmake-qt5 ../BuildDltViewer.pro
* make
* sudo make install
* sudo ldconfig
* Optional: set the library path: LD_LIBRARY_PATH = .

Create SDK (Windows)
--------------------

MinGW (32bit only):
* Install Qt5 SDK inclduing MinGW for Windows.
* If your Qt installation does not match "C:\Qt\Qt5.5.1\5.5\mingw492_32",
    you can set the correct path as environment variable "QTDIR" in your system properties.
* Adjust and run build_sdk_windows_qt5.bat batch file

Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 (32bit and 64bit):
* Install Qt5 SDK and MSVC 2013 (you can use the free "express" version).
* If your Qt installation does not match "C:\Qt\Qt5.5.1\5.5\msvc2013" (for 32 bit) or "C:\Qt\Qt5.5.1\5.5\msvc2013_64" (for 64 bit),
    you can set the correct path as environment variable "QTDIR" in your system properties.
* Adjust and run build_sdk_windows_qt5_MSVC.bat with optional parameter x86 or x86_amd64 (the current system's architecture is used by default).

The SDK will be installed to C:\Users\%USERNAME%\DltViewerSDK\

Optional: Prepare Installation Qwt (Windows)
--------------------------------------------

Some DLT Viewer plugins will use the Qwt library for displaying graphs.
The Qwt library must be compiled and installed before it can be used.

(Tested with Qwt 6.1.2)

MinGW (32bit only):
* Install Qt5 SDK inclduing MinGW for Windows.
* Extract Qwt Zip package
* Start Qt commandline from Start->Qt_5.x.x
* Change into Qwt directory
* Execute qmake qwt.pro
* Execute mingw32-make
* Execute mingw32-make install

Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 (32bit and 64bit):
* Install Qt5 SDK for Visual C++ 2013 (you can use the free "express" version)
* Extract Qwt Zip package
* If you like, you can adjust the installation path by changing the variable "QWT_INSTALL_PREFIX" in qwtconfig.pri
* Start Qt commandline from Start->Qt_5.x.x
* Change into Qwt directory
* Execute "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat" x86
    for 32bit, or
          "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat" x86_amd64
    for 64bit.
* Execute qmake qwt.pro
* Execute "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC\bin\nmake.exe"
* Execute "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC\bin\nmake.exe" install

Create SDK (Linux)
------------------

* Compile DLT Viewer as described in "Build DLT-viewer Linux"
* Call "sudo make install" to install dlt_viewer including libraries and headers for SDK

Create SDK Documentation (Windows)
----------------------------------

* Install doxygen and graphviz
* Change into project directory
* doxygen sdk\doxygen_dlt_viewer_plugininterface.cfg
* (Optional) doxygen sdk\doxygen_dlt_viewer.cfg
* (Optional) doxygen sdk\doxygen_dlt_viewer_qdlt.cfg
* You will find the documentation in the doc directory

Create SDK Documentation (Linux)
--------------------------------

* Install doxygen and graphviz
* Change into project directory
* doxygen sdk/doxygen_dlt_viewer_plugininterface.cfg
* (Optional) doxygen sdk/doxygen_dlt_viewer.cfg
* (Optional) doxygen sdk/doxygen_dlt_viewer_qdlt.cfg
* You will find the documentation in the doc directory

Create manuals documentation
----------------------------

The manuals are generated with asciidoc.
Call 
    asciidoc dlt_viewer_user_manual.txt
    asciidoc dlt_viewer_plugins_programming_guide.txt
to generate html output.
To generate pdfs, call
    sh convert.sh
from within the doc directory


Instructions for building DLT Viewer with CMake (Linux commandline)
----------------------------------------------------------
CMake is a "meta" make system.  This means CMake creates a make system 
for various make solutions including command line build tools like
"Unix Makefiles", or IDE tools like "Visual Studio".  
See:  https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/manual/cmake-generators.7.html

CMake encourages the "out of source" build paradigm. Assuming DLT Viewer 
code has been unpacked in path/src, we encourage not building in that directory

* mkdir build
* cd build
* cmake "GENERATOR OF CHOICE" path/src

At this stage, CMake will have produced a set of filesthat can be used by the
selected make system, be it "Unix Makefiles", "Visual Studio 6" or  other.
Often a DLT-Viewer.EXTENSION file will be present in the build directory.

In the case of "Unix Makefiles" building is now as simple as

* sudo make install
* sudo ldconfig
* Optional: set the library path: LD_LIBRARY_PATH = .

Various solutions exist for cmake configuration to be informed about 
non-standard installation paths for required components.  See CMake
documentation for details. (hint: QTDIR)

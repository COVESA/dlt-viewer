    * Fix forground color issue in search table model
    * Fix serial connect problem
    * Using better threshold for text color
        Improved the selection of the text color based on the background. Also
        fixed calculation (the real value has been used for red rather than the
        uint8 value).
    * Enable optional append for default filters
    * Combo Box for default filter is capable of search
        Allow to search a filter by a piece of the name in the defaultfilter
        combobox.
    * Load dlf from subfolders

        location. Symlinks are also allowed.

    * added regex setting to filter config

    * restore settings option ShowArguments
    * Sync view menu checkboxes with restored window state
        When the application is restarted the visibility state of the dock
        widgets does not reflect the checkboxes in the View menu. This will
        require activating menu items twice to make them in sync.
    * Introduction of the QDltFile::getFileMsgNumber method
        - Addition of the QDltFile::getFileMsgNumber method, which allows to get number of messages of the underlying file object
    * dltexport: Cancel message export implemented

        dltindexer: local variable covered parameter
            more detailed debug output

            when ECU in dlt file is given
            dlt injection: fix error when UTF8 ( chinese character)
            transmitted
        settingsdialog: avoid crash when resetting settings due to version change

Fixes:
    * src/filterdialog.cpp: Use QPalette::Window instead deprecated QPalette::Background
    * Fix Filter Log Level Min Max enabled by mistake.
    * Sort by time/timestamp keeps index order
        For messages that have the exact same time/timestamp, we keep the same order for the messages by using their index.
    * Fixed scroll in table view in case when Index column is hidden; disabled autoscroll to the right in search results
    * Fix filter load in case of error
        If a corrupted file has been passed to LoadFilter it still tried to load
        the filters after notifying the loading of the file failed. This caused
        a crash. Also the duplicate Messagebox has been removed.
    * Set scaling attributes after create QApplication
        Qt requires these attributes set after the creation else it will stay
        blurry on macOS.
    * Plugins are not working on Mac
        Change description:
        - Updated the INSTALL.txt for build instructions for release version using qmake on MacOs
        Verification criteria:
        - Build on MacOs Catalina Version 10.15.3(19D76) and checked
    * Fast bugfix for livetracing in dltfileindexer.cpp - disconnected when broom used
    * CMake build is not supported for MSVC
        - Introduction of wrapping GCC specific flags into "not MSVC" condition to avoid build fail for MSVC CMake build
    * Fixed enableMessageId in filter configuration file.
    * Do not raise search results panel every time the filters are updated
        If the user explicitly hid it they most likely prefer to keep it hidden.
        The panel will still be shown when the "FindNext" action is activated.
    * Fix non-standard binary install destination
        Use the destination variables defined in the toplevel CMakeLists instead
        of the hardcoded "deploy" directory. This makes the "install" target
        behave in the standard CMake way, i.e. allows to relocate the whole
        installation tree using CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX and find the binaries in
        the expected place.
    * Fix case insensitive regexp match in filters
        - Fix inverted condition when setting pattern options.
        - Fix incorrect passing of case sensitivity flag as match offset which
          prevented the ^ anchor from working.
    * Bugfix export index range
        Commandline mode: option -l, create file if not existing
        Adapt progress indication for index creation in commandline mode
